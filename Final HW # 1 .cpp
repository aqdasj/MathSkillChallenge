// This program will test fundamental math skills. The user will be given simple math questions of a fundamental math problem (addition, subtraction, or multiplication). 
// They can make up to three attempts per question. You will begin with 5 tokens, and if you fail to answer a problem within three attempts, you will lose one token.
// The game will continue until you decide to quit or run out of tokens. ;
